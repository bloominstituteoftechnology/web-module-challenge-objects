## Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript

## Objects

## Objectives

- use objects to store and access data
- learn to create methods on objects, and utilize the `this` keyword

## Introduction

You've been contracted by a restaurant to start building out their website. Before you work on any of the styling, you need to organzine your data in JavaScript. In this challenge you will work with different objects, constructors, and arrays of objects to manipulate data. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set up Project

- [x] Create a forked copy of this project
- [x] Add your team lead as collaborator on Github
- [x] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!)
- [x] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [x] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly
- [x] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`

### Task 2: MVP

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks until your returns look like the expected returns. Do not use any of the forbidden methods!

### Task 2b: Exit Tickets

Once you begin, you will have 15 minutes to answer the questions [here](https://app.codesignal.com/public-test/8fQpHe8YNqWDDdcw9/PS9Tnd4MRQre5h).

The completion of these questions is mandatory for MVP. However, passing the quiz doesn't affect your standing as a Lambda School student whatsoever. This is Lambda School testing itself! Please answer honestly and to the best of your ability without using external references.

### Task 3: Stretch

There are several stretch goals inside `index.js`. You may work on these once you have finished MVP requirements for the day!

## FAQs

**Why aren't my results showing up in the console?**

Make sure you are invoking your function after defining it in order to view results in the console.
