## Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript

## Objects

## Objectives

- use objects to store and access data
- learn to create methods on objects, and utilize the `this` keyword

## Introduction

You've been contracted by a restaurant to start building out their website. Before you work on any of the styling, you need to organzine your data in JavaScript. In this challenge you will work with different objects, constructors, and arrays of objects to manipulate data. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set up Project

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project
- [ ] Add your team lead as collaborator on Github
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!)
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`

### Task 2: MVP

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks until your returns look like the expected returns. Do not use any of the forbidden methods!

### Task 3: Stretch

There are several stretch goals inside `index.js`. You may work on these once you have finished MVP requirements for the day!

## FAQs
