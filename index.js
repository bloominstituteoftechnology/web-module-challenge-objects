Add to the function createMenuItems below so it will create objects following the same format found above for latte and breakfastBurrito (name, price, category).  
The function should:
  1. Receive values for the object that will be created as parameters
  2. Create and return an object using the received values 
  
  Example createMenuItem('tacos', 8, 'Lunch') should return {name: 'tacos', price: 8, category: 'Lunch'}

Invoke your function!
Test your createMenuItems function by doing the following:
  1. Pass values to createMenuItems in order to create the objects (menu items)
  2. Create at least 3 menu items (objects) of your choosing making sure they have name, price, and category keys
  3. Log each returned object to the console  
  
  For example: createMenuItem("pizza",5,"lunch") would return this as the object: {name:"Pizza",price:5,category:"lunch"}

You're having a lunch special! 25% off for teachers and students, 10% off for everyone else. Add a method to the 
burger object below that automatically calculates price depending on the a string received as a parameter. 

Using the burger object below do the following:
  1. Add a method called discount to the burger object 
  2. The discount method should accept a string as a parameter (example: "teacher", "student", or "public")
  3. Depending on the string, it will return the correct discounted price
  4. Check your work by invoking the function and passing in 'teacher', 'student', or 'public' as your arguments to ensure they are returning the correct price.

  For example: burger.discount("teacher") would return 13.5 and burger.discount("public") would return 16.2

 the addReview function below to do the following:
  1. Receive an array
  2. Receive the following object keys name, rating, feedback
  3. The function should push the following object to the array: {name: 'Daniela', rating: 5, review: 'Beautiful atmosphere and wonderful vegan options!' }

Write a function to return a review based on the index of the review in the array.

Use the getReviewByIndex function below to do the following:
  1. Receive an array
  2. Receive a number which is the desired index in the array
  3. The function should return the following string: "{name} gave the restaurant a {rating} star review, and their feedback was: {feedback}"
  For example: getReviewByIndex(reviews,0) would return: "Daniela gave the restaurant a 5 star review, and their feedback was: Beautiful atmosphere and wonderful vegan options!"

  1. Receive an array of objects as a parameter
  2. Return the last index as a string in the format: "{name} gave the restaurant a {rating} star review, and their feedback was: {feedback}"
  3. Invoke the function with the reviews array as the argument

  3. Return an array with all the reviews in that range

  1. Receive the array that holds all the reviews
  2. Return an array with all the reviews that have more than 15 words in their feedback

This stretch goal does not use the reviews data!  You create your own object in this stretch goal.

Use the carMaker function below to do the following:
  1. Receive a value representing the odometer (how many miles it's been driven) and use that when creating the object
  2. Create a drive method inside the object that increases the odometer value
  3. Return the object
  4. The returned object with the odometer value should have the following characteristics:
     a. The drive method which, when called, takes a distance value as its parameter
     b. The drive method should also cause the odometer value in the object to be increased by the distance
     c. Then the drive method should return the updated value of the odometer

  For example: Let's say we created the object in the variable car1 with an odometer value of 10.
  Then we called car1.drive(100)
  It would return 110 because it was created with 10 as the odometer and we added 100 to it with the drive method
