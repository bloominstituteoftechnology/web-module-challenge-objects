/* Task 2: You're having a lunch special! 25% off for teachers and students, 10% off for everyone else. Add a method to your burger object that automatically calculates price given a string as a parameter. 

Your method should accept: 

(1) A string (teacher, student, or public)

and should return a number. 

For example, burger.discount("teacher") would return 13.5 and burger.discount("public") would return 16.2*/



///////////////Reviews (MVP)///////////////////

    {name: "Wen", rating: 4.5, feedback:"I don't leave my house often, but when I do, it's for this place. Highly reccomend."},
    {name: "Brett", rating: 3, feedback: "great selection of snacks and a nice cafe area to get work done during the day."},
    {name: "Julius", rating: 2, feedback: "I was largely unimpressed by this venue. Nothing special on the menu and too expensive. The atmosphere is polarizing, and not for me, but I think some would like it." },
    {name:"Lauren", rating: 4, feedback: "Absolutely love that they have karaoke Fridays! Food and drink selection is okay."},

/* Task 4: Add a new rating with your (fictitious) opinions of the restaurant in the same format as the reviews above. */


/* Task 5: Add the following feedback to Reyna's rating - "this place is chill with really cool people, great for getting work done on weekdays"

/*  Task 6: Write a function to return a review based on the index of the review in the array.

 Your function should take two arguments:

(1) an array which holds all of the reviews
(2) a number which is the desired index in the array.

and should return a string in the format `{name} gave the restaurant a {rating}, and their feedback was: {feedback}`
 * 
 * For example, if getReviewByIndex is invoked with reviews and the number 0
 * it will return `Daniela gave the restaurant a 5 star review and their feedback was: Beautiful atmosphere and wonderful vegan options!`
*/

/* Task 7: Write a function to get information about the most recent review called `getLastReview`

getLastReview should accept:
  (1) an array of objects 
  
and should return a string in the format `name} gave the restaurant a {rating}, and their feedback was: {feedback}`

For example, if getLastReview is invoked passing the reviews array it will return `Reyna gave the restaurant a 3.5 star review and their feedback was: "this place is chill with really cool people, great for getting work done on weekdays"`.

     it has an `odometer` property that contains the argument passed in.
     it has a `drive` method that takes a distance as its argument, and
         (1) causes the odometer in the object to be increased by the distance,
